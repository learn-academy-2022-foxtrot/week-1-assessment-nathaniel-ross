# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a software that tracks any changes in codes, or files that can be shared among developers to keep their files up to date. It keeps track of updates as a sort of patch note system. GitHub uses git as a way to share the files via an online server hosted on GitHub.com. Essentially, Git is for local files, stored on your computer, and you use GitHub to upload and pull files from the internet.

Researched answer: Git is an open-sourced version control software used as a command line tool that tracks any changes of code stored locally on your computer system. GitHub is an online hosting service primarilly used to host source code and any changes made via Git, stored online so that you can share and collaborate source code and source code changes with fellow programmers.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Three logical operators will return a Boolean value, AND, OR, and NOT. AND operators return a statement that works if both statements are true, OR only requires one statement to be true, while NOT statements return the opposite of AND statements.

Researched answer: There are three logical operators that return a Boolean value; AND, OR, and NOT. AND operators are represented by two ampersands (&&) and requires both arguments to be true to return a true statement, if one is true and one is false it will return false. OR operators are represented by two vertical line symbols (||) and require only one argument to be true to return a true statement, if one is true and one is false it will return true, as there is one true and it only needs one. NOT operators represented by an exclamation point (!) will return the inverse of the argument, if the argument is true, NOT will return false, and vice versa.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: The index is the order in which the value is tracked in an array. The index starts with 0 and goes up from there, so for example if in an index you have 3 seperate values, the first would be index 0, the second index 1, and the third index 2. Values are the actual data filled inside of the array.

Researched answer: An index tells us where the position of a piece of information is stored in a string or an array. The value is the actual information that is stored in a variable, consisting of primitive datatypes like numbers, strings, booleans etc. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings.

Your answer: Arrays and strings both do similar things such as holding information together. A string holds characters together like letters to create a word, while an array holds multiple similar elements like multiple words, numbers, etc. the main difference being an array can hold a collection of variables, while a string can hold a single one.

Researched answer: An array is a data structure that holds a group of elements with a similar data typ in an indexed list, while a string is a sequence that characters together such as letters numbers or symbols. Strings can only hold characters while an array can hold any data types and are also able to be mutated using mutators and accessors. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming consists of at least two programmers, where one participant is the "driver" and the other(s) would be the "navigator". The driver shares their screen with the others and is the only one phsyically working on the actual code. The navigator helps the driver by directing them on what they should be doing to the actual code. After a certain amount of time, the roles would switch, allowing everyone to help direct as a navigator and also phsyically type in the code as the driver. Working as a pair has many benefits and can lead to a lot of problem solving while working together through the code.

Researched answer: Pair programing is a software development technique consisting of two programmers, one being the "driver" the other being the "navigator". The driver writes the actual code while the navigator guides, observes, and is a safety net for for driver, which frees the driver to focus entirely on writing the code. The roles switch after a certain amount of time so both programmers are able to equally work through the code. Having two progammers work on the same code comes with many benefits such as being able to problem solve as a team, and having different viewpoints that benefit the end goal. Many programmers say they prefer this method to working alone.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher Order Functions are functions that take another function as a parameter and then returns a function. This can be used to streamline your code by insteading of having multiple functions, you add a function to a pre-existing one to do the same thing that two functions would do.

2. Jest: Jest is a testing framwork for JavaScript that allows you to run tests on your code. You install Jest into your text editor using a JavaScript package manager, and using Jest's .test commands and file saving system, it will run the code and check for any errors in your testing process.

3. Objects: An object is a reference data type that is more complex than primitive data types, it's an unordered collection that can be given multiple properties or key-value pairs.

4. Method: A method in JavaScript is a property in an object that also contains a function. A function can be its individual code that performs a task, while a method must be associated with an object.

5. Classes: Classes are used to encompass multiple objects, which can be used to group objects together that can then be modified. This is helpful for minimizing repeating code, instead of making multiple variations of the same object, you can class the objects and then have the objects within the class be diferent variations.
